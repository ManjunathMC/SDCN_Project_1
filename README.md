**Finding Lane lines on the Road**

This project deals with the detection of the Lane lines on the road as a part of Self driving car nanodegree.

Here a video is read and the pre-processed before finding the lanes.  Pre-processing includes converting images to grayscale,
smoothing via gaussian, followed by edge detection, region selection and finally Hough lines detection.  Details of each step will
be elobarated more while explaining the procedure in detail.
